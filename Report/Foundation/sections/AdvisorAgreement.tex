The group emphasizes that it is the group itself, not the supervisor, who is responsible for the group's learning. However, the supervisor has a responsibility to push the group in the right direction, as the supervisor can be consulted with doubts and questions. The supervisor can also provide feedback on written work the group has produced.

All members of the group are expected to participate in the meetings. Both the group and the advisor are expected to arrive prepared at meetings. At meetings, the group has prepared an agenda and the supervisor has read and addressed the possible issues submitted by the group.
Emails from both parties are generally expected to be answered within one-two business days.

The group expects that there will be a meeting every week, unless there is no need for this. Supervisor meetings last 45-60 minutes and will take place on Tuesdays (3-4 pm). Meetings and agendas should be announced no later than the day before the instructions. The group should produce a transcript of the discussed topics after each meeting, which should then be distributed to group members and the supervisor.
